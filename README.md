A fast solver for games in the Boggle family, e.g. WordBrain, Work
Trek, etc. Given a puzzle to solve, this library will compute all
possible words that can be spelled (i.e. it can provide word hints).

## Usage

```clojure
;; solve for all words in the provided 4x4 matrix that are of length
;; 3, 6 or 7.
word-trek-solver.core> (solve "ezmrnubeslospaon" [3 6 7])
=> ("embolus" "loo" "saloon" "saloons" "sub" "ens" "pal" "plumbs"
"nos" "lap" "alb" "sum" "sob" "sap" "sol" "lob" "reb" "bus" "eon"
